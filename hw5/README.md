 learning.cpp takes in an input file of workloads matched with benefits for different classes, outputting the maximum benefit
 acheivable under an upper bound on work.
 
 doublet.cpp implements A* search using a personalized heap to play the "doublet" game. The program starts with two words for
 input and a list of possible intermediate words and outputs the optimal path between the start words, changing one letter a 
 time, only using words in the given list.
