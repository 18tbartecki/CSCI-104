Problem 1: Heaps

1.      C
      /   \
     H     E
    / \   / \
   M   I S   T
  / \
 R   Y

2.This is a minHeap because every child is "less" than its parent as it comes later in the alphabet. C is before H 
  and E, H is before M and I, E is before S and T, and M is before R and Y.


3.       C
       /   \
      /     \
     D       E
    / \     / \
   /   \   /   \
  M     H S     T
 / \   /
R   Y I


4.      D
      /   \

    / \   / \
   M   I S   T
